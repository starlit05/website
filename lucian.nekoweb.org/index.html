            <p>worked on the website today. i claimed a <a href="https://webtiles.kicya.net/#-875,-1875">webtile</a> but i'll make it look better later. i spent ages working on my button but then i realized i could just style it in html then eraser bucket tool the excess in csp. i also spent literally forever messing with the shinji pagedoll and the kaworu png used for the button. pinterest -&gt; ditherit.com -&gt; remove.bg pipeline. beware!!! </p>
            <p>mmm. when it comes to personal updates, i'll be flying back home tonight. technically we have a layover but the layover <em>is</em> on the way home. i'll be back in the U.S in 2-3 days basically. the philippines and japan was really nice, and even though i don't like hanging out with my relatives, it was good to see them. the thing i enjoyed the most was definitely getting to buy some nge merch, including a kaworu figure! when i get home and unpack, i'll take a picture and try to remember to post it in the nekoweb server, <a href="https://luciansdiary.tumblr.com">my tumblr</a>, and here.</p>
