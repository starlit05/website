                  <p>the jetlag is making it hard for me to keep up with my meds, so i'm switching from after-dinner to after-lunch as the time to take them. pms sucks and i get 3x more of it if i don't take my meds properly. i thought a lot about killing myself today, but it would be too painful if i attempted. i ended up drawing a new banner for my tumblr. i'm going on a day trip with my cousins today. i'm nervous since i don't get to hang out with them a lot. i'm still stuck between "he hates me" and "i deserve to be hated" and "maybe we can still talk, if not be friends" and "i'll just wish him a happy birthday." why am i so stupid? i just wish i could be less impulsive and dumb all the time.</p>

                  <p>fell asleep too early last night. 4pm -> 11pm meant roughly 7  hours of sleep. i ended up staying up until dawn and had to wake my mom up to remind her i had to go to school. it was a tiring day. i was needlessly cruel to my math teacher. i felt very guilty afterwards, but guilt doesn't do anything, at least not directly. i had bad thoughts through the night since i couldn't sleep. i kept thinking about this relationship that i ruined a few months ago. i can't decide if i wish that i could communicate better, so this never happened, or if i wish that i never communicated (including lashing out) at all. for most of my life, the latter has been the winning option, and yet i logically know that thats Not Good For Me.</p>
                  <p>on a happier note, i finished my webtile! <a href="https://webtiles.kicya.net/#-1125,-2375">go look</a> at my salt-wound routine-themed webtile. yi xi my beloved. now that it's not bedtime my body is going "well i'm sleepy now." and making me eyes droop and close. i need to get out of my comfy bed and grab some chips and sit in an eating (read: uncomfortable and bad) position at the dinner table. okay i have obtained chip bag. mmmmm what's some other good news? i got a laptop case from my cousin for my birthday. it came with a keyboard cover and a screen protector. the laptop case and keyboard protector are tinted purple, but the keyboard protector is an ugly desaturated mauve-like color which is too cowardly to be pink or purple. yet i will keep it because it is not worth replacing. the screen protector i have applied poorly. there are bubbles in it, but that is fine. i changed the scrollbar color on the site from gray to cherry red. i hope it looks nicer. i'm planning to start work on the "additional writing" pages. i tried to drink water consistently today, but i ran out before i could guzzle a whole lot on the bus back home like always.</p>

                <summary>january 9</summary>
                  <p>worked on the website today. i claimed a <a href="https://webtiles.kicya.net/#-875,-1875">webtile</a> but i'll make it look better later. i spent ages working on my button but then i realized i could just style it in html then eraser bucket tool the excess in csp. i also spent literally forever messing with the shinji pagedoll and the kaworu png used for the button. pinterest -&gt; ditherit.com -&gt; remove.bg pipeline. beware!!! </p>
                  <p>mmm. when it comes to personal updates, i'll be flying back home tonight. technically we have a layover but the layover <em>is</em> on the way home. i'll be back in the U.S in 2-3 days basically. the philippines and japan was really nice, and even though i don't like hanging out with my relatives, it was good to see them. the thing i enjoyed the most was definitely getting to buy some nge merch, including a kaworu figure! when i get home and unpack, i'll take a picture and try to remember to post it in the nekoweb server, <a href="https://luciansdiary.tumblr.com">my tumblr</a>, and here.</p>
