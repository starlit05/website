            <p>some sort of sewer creature. definitely crawled out of something somewhere. does not care about things such as "gender binaries" and "laws." uses they/them, fond of long skirts, and is the "religious serial killer" in this story. there are too many <s>people</s> anomalies in the world. not like when <em>they</em> were a child (??? probably late 30's)</p>
            <h5>what's an anomaly?</h5>
              <p>you know. an anomaly. someone who's not quite right. </p>
