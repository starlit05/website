            <p>imagine a woman with blue hair and pronouns. okay now imagine a woman with blue hair and pronouns and she works minimum wage at fantasy starbucks and rents a shitty apartment with like 4 roommates over it. she has exactly one friend and they hang out and watch anime after their shifts. and frankly if she had to deviate from this routine she'd feel so pissed off she'd probably kill herself.</p>
            <p>okay now imagine she's had this mindset and this life for the past, what, 7 years? nothing has changed. she's not capable of change, she'll keep being like this and <s>everyone will leave</s> that's fine. change is scary, you know? becoming a woman was scary too, but that was for good, not like other types of change.</p>
            <p>to clarify: i wrote this story before i knew about and got into dungeon meshi. if you haven't watched it go do that. this section contains spoilers for it!!! with that out of the way, altair and marcille are very similar. they're half-elves with inconsistent lifespans and are treated oddly about it.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>the story</h2>
          <section class="boxy">
            <p>okay now imagine altair got called in for jury duty except for when she got there the judges were like "hey girl so basicalllyyyyyyy the president got kidnapped :facepalm: so we need you to go get her and if you succeed you can quit your shitty job :thumbsup:" and altair was like ":redexclamationmark: i can quit my job!?"</p>
