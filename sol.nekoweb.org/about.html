              <dd>complicated? culturally american; ethnically filipino; ancestrally filipino (tagalog), han chinese, spanish, and lot of other east asian stuff. for short i just call myself filipino-american</dd>

          <p>i'm not a very interesting person nor do i consider myself to possess a personality, but i try. i'm sol and this is my website. i like to write html and <span class="ttt" title="a lot of 'barcode-scrubbed-off' oc work and halfhearted self-portraits tbh">draw pictures</span>. i like to think of myself as a writer even though i don't write a lot. the idea of ~being smart~ is very alluring to me as it is to most, i guess. i like cats more than dogs and it takes me a long time to get around to watching/reading/listening to something.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
                <dd>i'm sol. i like to draw.</dd>
                
                <dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
                <dd>since march of 2024, so as of today (january 2026) almost two years!</dd>
                
                <dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
                <dd>i found <a href="https://webring.koinuko.pink/">the original self-insert webring</a> while mindlessly scrolling the internet and noticed that it would be shutting down soon and the fear of missing out got to me, so i started learning html and css so i could have a page for my little widget to live on.</dd>
                
                <dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
                <dd>i like ones with blogs.</dd>
                
                <dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
                <dd>sometimes i plan my layouts out, but more often i find myself throwing whatever comes to mind together as it comes.</dd>
                
                <dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
                <dd>i mostly actually based my more recent layouts on old layouts i did, which i have no screenshots of.</dd>
                
                <dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
                <dd>when they look nice and other people like them :&rpar;</dd>
                
                <dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
                <dd>i'm pretty averse to using javascript in any situation, but it's not hard. i just find free resources other people make.</dd>
                
                <dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
                <dd>before i tried to keep the same layout on every page, but now i want to be more free.</dd>
                
                <dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
                <dd>i'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate. i don't know anything about 3d css or complicated transitions or anything.</dd>
                
                <dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
                <dd>i hope so?</dd>
                
                <dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
                <dd>i like semantic html like header, aside, main, footer, section, etc.</dd>
                
                <dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
                <dd>i look up how to do it on mdn web docs. i'm forgetful and not good at doing things from scratch.</dd>
                
                <dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
                <dd>nope!</dd>
                
                <dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
                <dd>nekoweb doesn't support it and i don't know what i'd use it for.</dd>
                
                <dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
                <dd>this time around i want it to be purple, but sometimes it doesn't.</dd>
                
                <dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
                <dd>i want to focus more on content, but i always spend too much time on design.</dd>
                
                <dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
                <dd>i don't own a domain name, but i'd like to. maybe something like "aortic.work" or copycat-something; i'm not very original.</dd>
                
                <dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
                <dd>they're cool if they add a personal spin to the aesthetic. if not i find them to be mostly copy-and-paste (i.e boring).</dd>
                
                <dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
                <dd>i think it is, and i only check if there's an error i can't figure out.</dd>
                
                <dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>

                <dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt>
                <dd>it's like having a visual list of people's sites you like. pretty neat to see how other people use such a small canvas.</dd>
                
                <dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
                <dd>probably make something similar. i'm not very original.</dd>
                
                <dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
                <dd>sometimes, but then i remember that i'm the only me who can make what i do, even if it seems similar to others' work.</dd>
                
                <dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
                <dd>i used to use phcode, but i switched to vscode. i might use nekode if i get desperate.</dd>
                
                <dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
                <dd>vscode offers git support and since i have it downloaded, can be used offline. i don't like the ai features and i don't use them.</dd>
                
                <dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
                <dd>i try to host them on my nekoweb site, but sometimes i get worried and use <a href="https://filegarden.com">filegarden</a>.</dd>
                
                <dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
                <dd>i only used nekoweb because neocities was blocked on my school chromebook, but now that both are blocked i'm partial to nekoweb as it's the only web host i've ever used. the whole pro-ai thing with neocities' owner kind of put me off, too. overall i don't see it as a huge issue.</dd>
                
                <dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>

                <dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>

                <dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
                <dd>i stick to purple because i like purple and it makes me pleased when i see it.</dd>
                
                <dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
                <dd>i did go on a rather long hiatus when i changed my site url often and cleared all my files. this was because of burnout, but i'm back now with more to yap about.</dd>
                
                <dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>

                <dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
                <dd>i get disappointed with my previous work frequently, so i scrap and restart a lot.</dd>
                
                <dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
                <dd>hobby-focused. i don't see myself as having much to talk about regarding myself, so i want to focus on the things i do.</dd>
                
                <dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
                <dd>nope.</dd>

                <dd>yeah, tumblr, pinterest, sometimes bluesky.</dd>
                
                <dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>

                <dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>

                  </ul>
                </dd>
                
                <dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
                <dd>macos. once i become more computer literate i might switch to linux mint or something.</dd>
                
                <dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
                <dd>just happen to use it.</dd>

                <dd>i have some, but they're sort of personal. i like to see how people discovered media and what they first thought about them.</dd>
                
                <dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>
                <dd>maybe? i don't really care.</dd>
                
                <dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt>
                <dd>my ideal website is a website where i am honest. i am not good at this.</dd>
