        <p>honestly, at this point i can't even see it as a vice. something simple will happen and i will become disproportionately upset. then i will cry while thinking of ways i might kill myself and what would happen if it went wrong. because that's the only thing that <em>can</em> happen, it all going wrong. because when it comes down to it, God hates me very much, or at least is indifferent enough to permit the devil to torment me. why else shower me with the privileges of middle-class, American, suburban life and turn around and plant endless fantasies of my own lucid death in my mind?</p>
        <p>i consider myself an agnostic. the upbringing i had as a devout christian- and still am forced to endure- continues to weigh on me. not heavily, but it weighs nonetheless. my guilt "complex" (it's really quite simple) can be easily traced back to the idea of original sin. my own original sin changes with each mistake i make, each time i hurt and push and scream and say something i shouldn't. but it always feels like the sins are in my nature. i can't change. i can never be happy. if i am sinful and God hates me, who am i to be compared to if not the devil himself? bit melodramatic, but ah well.</p>
        <p>i don't know. it's a strange feeling, to desire worse. it's never enough sin for me, i guess. i want to have OCD; the people i care for spiraling don't deserve it, but i do. i want to have DID; i want to be free from my own mind. it'll be someone else in control for once. it's not even original, which is sad. i copied the person i hurt the most. i'm a shitty "friend" (abuser). i am no better than my father. i don't deserve to die, but god i wish someone would shoot me in the head tonight and escape unnoticed. i want to be dead; it's called the "eternal sleep" for a reason. at least when i'm asleep, i can't think. and if i can't think then i'm free.</p>
        <p>at least, if i'm dead, i can't hurt anybody anymore. i can't lash out, i can't push, i can't scream, i can't cry. i get to be dead, forever and ever and ever and ever and everyone i know and think i love will be finally happy all without me. all i ever do is use people and throw them away, so when i am gone it'll all be wonderful again. i want things to be wonderful, without me. the next best thing is to become numb on antidepressants. i've read it's a common side effect, and if i fail to kill myself i hope i experience it. no more being angry or sad or scared. it'll all be a dull ache in the back of my mind. it's weird, the dullness is something i've wanted even longer than the death. that's weird.</p>
        <p>speaking of time, it's my birthday today. i didn't spiral too bad, as compared to other times, but man. i was really hoping today would end on a high note. we went out for dinner. it tasted like slop. i had some desert. it tasted like slop. i go home, realize i've lost one of my treasured posessions, and cry and think about finally slitting my wrists open longwise in the night so nobody realizes i'm going before i'm gone. looks like that didn't work out. the things i used to try and convince myself to stay alive for anymore don't work anymore. i can't bring myself to care about deltarune. all i do is make my friends miserable- why would i be selfish and try and cling to life for them? the promised haircut won't work. i will never, never be a real boy.</p>
        <p>and what? i try to seek help? so an adult can say big words about how brave i am and how my feelings are valid and teach me breathing exercises. i got my hopes up for real, professional care and got told "sorry, you have issues that require weekly sessions but we don't offer those! try group DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)! oh, you're too fucking braindead to stop and think and use any of these skills? too bad, have fun screwing up until you've had enough! i'm sorry. it's very selfish of me to do all this. i write and write and write and i reach out and nobody knows what to do and i am ultimately just a burden. i'm pissed off and sad and i don't want everyone to leave me but they will they will they will they will all leave but if i die first then theyll remember me forever and ever and ever. and you can tell i'm not really sorry too because i will keep typing and casually mention it and smile and say i'm doing just fine tomorrow morning again and again forever. i want it to be over.</p>
